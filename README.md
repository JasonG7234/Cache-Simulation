# Cache Simulation

This is a project created for a Rutgers New Brunswick Systems Programming class. It involves simulating a cache and counting cache hits and misses for given addresses. It does not implement temporal or spatial locality, but rather was a simple project designed to learn the basics behind caches. Design choices are described in the readme.pdf.
